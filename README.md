Full Stack Scala
================

This is my presentation from _ScalaDays Berlin 2018_.

Clone the repo, and start sbt.
Run 'reStart' to start the server.

Head to [localhost:8080|http://localhost:8080] to see the presentation.

Examples
--------

The presentation is written in ScalaJS and there is a Dev Console (hit Control-D to toggle) that allows you to play with the examples
using [groll|https://github.com/sbt/sbt-groll].

Start with 'groll initial' then use 'groll next' and 'groll back' to move through the examples I presented.
